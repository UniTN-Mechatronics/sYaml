# sYaml - Swift wrapper to libyaml

This is a swift wrapper to libyaml 1.1.

## Status

At the moment the project is experimental and supports Swift 1.2 and libyaml 1.1.

## Usage

A better installation/usage guide will follow. For the moment, start by executing `./prepare_liyaml.sh`, then build and run the sYaml target, and look at its setting. 

Currently two targets are available: a OS X framework and a demo OS X app using the framework. The framework exposes the Swift module `sYaml`.

Unit testing for the framework are in preparation.
